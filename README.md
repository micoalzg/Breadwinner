This is an Android app that allows users to order inexpensive, healthy, home-cooked meals from registered cooks on the platform. It connects hungry customers with amateur to professional cooks who enjoy cooking and are looking to make some money with the freedom of not working for any restaurant. Cooks are able to post daily menus for users to order from, as well as arranging pickup or delivery.

#### Who are your target users?

One set of target users are students who want an alternative to eating greasy, expensive, and unauthentic restaurant food.

The other set of target users are the providers of the food. Our app allows for anyone with a kitchen to apply as a cook, so people who enjoy cooking or always have leftovers will be able to make some quick cash.

Susan is a stay-at-home mom who wants to make some money on the side and is able to cook for other people in addition to herself. She sets up an account on our app and declares a 30 minute meeting time for when people can pick up whatever she planned to make for that day.

Bob is a student living off-campus who pays high prices to eat out everyday. He misses authentic home-cooked food and would like a healthier and cheaper alternative. He sets up an account on our app and is able to order authentic home-cooked food that costs a fraction of the price of eating out and is a lot more healthy.
