# BREADWINNER TEAM 7

## Deliverable 3 Sprint 2

* Start date: November 19th, 2018

* End date: November 26th, 2018


## Process

#### Changes from the previous iteration

We aren’t making any major changes to our process. Since deliverable 2 we’ve been more mindful of how long each task takes after being able to experience them, and so a decision we made in the last sprint was to keep workloads in mind when assigning tasks. We applied this by assigning multiple backend functions to one person, as opposed to assigning one per person, as we’ve realized that backend functions are not too hard. This turned out to be successful in the last sprint, as everyone more or less had the same workload, and we didn’t have anybody complaining that they had too much to do, or that they finished their contribution in 10 minutes.


#### Roles & responsibilities

\- Frontend: finish adding backend functionality to each frontend page 

​	- (5P) JAVA CODING: hook up the following API. 

1. Add listing, (SEAN)

2. Listing closing (When a cook no longer wants to take orders) (RAYMOND)

​    & listing details (i.e. tracking num orders), 

3. order history, (JERRY)

4. log in API, make basic XML (MICHAEL)

5. cook review/rating  (TASBIR)

​	- (1P) Misc:  (CRYSTAL)

\- Clean up any views, make it look PRETTY, NICE, and UNIFORM throughout the application, also make sure everything is centered 

\- Design a logo for out app

\- (If we have time) Find a solution to adding images to listings

#### Events

We had this planning meeting in person on November 19, 2018, to allocate tasks and figure out what remaining tasks we need to do to present an MVP. We are planning on meeting the following Monday, also in person, to have a review meeting and tie up any loose ends we have with our product.

#### Artifacts

We also have a group chat, as displayed in our last sprint’s docs, where everyone can communicate, give clarifications of details, etc.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

We will each create a branch of the master repo and commit changes to our respective branches. Branches will allow each person to view and test their peers’ work before merging new features to the master. The merge should be collaboratively done by any members who have code affected by the merge conflict. 

## Product

For this sprint, we want to wrap our project up, which involves hooking up the remaining backend functions to the frontend. As a result, users will be able to:

- Add a listing from the app
- Manage their own listings (close them, view how many people have ordered)
- View order history from the app
- Login to the app to have a way to identify users when adding a listing, etc
- Adding reviews for a specific user

We also want to refactor existing code and frontend XMLs. We hope to integrate images somehow into our app as well, but worst case scenario, we will use a predefined generic food image for each listing.


#### Artifacts

We want to produce Java files that successfully integrate the above functionality into our app.

We planned a bit before leaving, so we came up with these diagrams for data flow in these pages.
