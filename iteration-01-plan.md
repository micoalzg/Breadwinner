#### Goals and tasks

- Database design (mongoDB)

- - To give a transparent view of what data would be stored. Also is a plan in how we will implement the database

- Template of Views

We want to design basic front end views of what different screens of our app will look like.

- Structure for the project.

#### Artifacts

1. Different “views” of what our app will look like. We’ll start coding up prototypes of what different screens in our app will look like, for example, the listing screen, in order to familiarize ourselves with Android studio and get an idea of what our app will look like.

2. Database design doc that summarizes the type of information that our app will keep track of.
