#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build an Android app that allows users to order inexpensive, healthy, home-cooked meals from registered cooks on the platform. It connects hungry customers with amateur to professional cooks who enjoy cooking and are looking to make some money with the freedom of not working for any restaurant. Cooks will be able to post daily menus for users to order from, as well as arranging pickup or delivery.

A tag system will be implemented, making it easier for clients to search for what type of foods they want and for cooks to find clients easily. A rating and review system will be implemented, allowing clients to rate their experience with the cook and mention dishes they liked or didn’t like. The ratings and reviews will include what kind of food was ordered and their experience with the chef. 

Many people who don’t cook for themselves face the problem of paying high prices for unhealthy, unauthentic restaurant food. Our app will target this issue by providing authentic, inexpensive home-cooked meals for these people. While this app helps consumers eating on a budget, cooks experience mutual benefits. People who enjoy cooking, or those who simply cook too many leftovers, will be able to make some extra cash at their own flexibility.

Use cases include students living away from home who want a cheap, home-cooked meal and anyone who enjoys to cook for other people or people who happen to make too much food when they cook.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

One set of target users are students who want an alternative to eating greasy, expensive, and unauthentic restaurant food.

The other set of target users are the providers of the food. Our app allows for anyone with a kitchen to apply as a cook, so people who enjoy cooking or always have leftovers will be able to make some quick cash.

Susan is a stay-at-home mom who wants to make some money on the side and is able to cook for other people in addition to herself. She sets up an account on our app and declares a 30 minute meeting time for when people can pick up whatever she planned to make for that day.

Bob is a student living off-campus who pays high prices to eat out everyday. He misses authentic home-cooked food and would like a healthier and cheaper alternative. He sets up an account on our app and is able to order authentic home-cooked food that costs a fraction of the price of eating out and is a lot more healthy.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need? 

Our app will provide a platform for home cooks like Susan to announce a list of dishes they will be making for that day. Customers like Bob will be able to search for and purchase home-cooked meals from cooks like Susan for an inexpensive price with little to no delivery cost, as the client and cook would be able to decide on a mutually exclusive place to meet.  

As of now, the only available solution to this problem is a group chat on WeChat that connects stay at home moms with students on campuses such as University of Waterloo and University of Toronto. The downsides to this are that it is very region-limited so people outside of these campus locations would not be able to use this service. Access to these groups are also very exclusive, as an invite would have to be sent in order for anyone to join. More importantly, using WeChat for this service is very unorganized, as it is essentially a chatroom where menus and orders are placed over messages in the chat. Orders may be easily missed due to a high volume of messages being sent in the group. Our app will provide an organized and efficient alternative platform that makes it easy for cooks to view the exact number of dishes to make, and ensures that all orders placed by clients will be filled, as opposed to being lost in a sea of messages in the group chat. 

The benefits of using our app includes a more authentic and cheaper alternative to eating out at restaurants, and this will be beneficial to people who don’t cook and eat out at restaurants everyday (for example, students living away from home). People who enjoy cooking but have nobody to share their food with, or people who make a lot of food and usually have leftovers will be able to reap the benefits of this app too, as they’d be able to make some money on the side.

The closest existing app on the market is Ritual. A user on Ritual can order a meal from a restaurant and walk to the location to pick up their order. The difference between our app and Ritual is that to use our app, you do not have to own a restaurant to sell food on our platform, so almost anyone can sell food on our app.

### Highlights

##### Are there still benefits of being a cook if the cook gets a low number of orders?

- New cooks who join the app may have a lower number of order requests per delivery
- A cook has the flexibility of setting their own dish price and pick up location. They may start out by setting lower costs 
- Overtime, they can build their reputation as a cook through customer reviews and ratings
- With a good customer rating, cooks will accumulate more customers per delivery

##### Difficulties of Starting Out as a Cook

We were considering how new cooks joining may receive a lower number of order requests per delivery, which could drive potential cooks off of our app. We decided to implement a reputation system (feedback, ratings and review) as a solution. New cooks will be able to build their reputation as a cook through customer reviews and ratings. With a good customer rating, cooks will accumulate more customers per delivery.

##### Evaluation and Feedback

We were considering a method for clients and cooks to leave feedback on each other, as this allows clients to promote “good” cooks, and incentivizes good behavior on the client’s part. At first, we thought a star rating out of 5 would be enough, and would probably be more beneficial on the aspect of simplicity. However, we decided that this implementation is too general. In particular, clients wouldn’t be able to leave feedback on what dishes they liked and didn’t like. As a result, we’ve decided to implement a Yelp-like system, with a star rating as well as a review.

##### Client Convenience

We are thinking of adding some features to improve convenience on the client side. An idea we had was an implementation of a “one button” order system, similar to Uber’s “one button” dispatch system, which would find a single cook listing that would be optimized based on location. However, we’ve decided against that, as we figured that the user may want to customize their search. Instead, we decided to implement a tagging system that allows users to sort cook listings by type of food, price, etc. This allows the user to find exactly what they’re looking for.
