## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 13th 7:30pm
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

Creating teams for front-end design and back-end design

-Team organization and task assignment went well, we were able to complete the tasks that we assigned within the 3 days left before the deadline.

-While developing different views and displays, we were to experiment with Android Studio and familiarize with programming different app components

Making use of an online scrum board Trello

-Increased organization of our project by clearly highlighting tasks to do, and letting us checkoff things we’ve done

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

We didn’t get the Iteration 1 planning meeting done early enough so we were not able to accomplish as much as we should have.

We originally planned to localhost the database, but figured it was a bad idea since it doesn’t have 24/7 uptime.


#### Planned changes

START THE PLANNING MEETING EARLIER

-didn’t have as much time as we wanted to do database design, play around with Android Studio


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
We ended up accomplishing everything needed in this iteration.

Database design

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

We managed to complete every task planned in this iteration.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insight is to implement the most prioritized features of the app. We will add diagrams and design the different application activities, fragments, drawables, etc.

We need to learn how to setup the files for our project, make folders for the client code, server code, routing etc..

We might need to reallocate tasks, in case the backend becomes too much work for 2 people.
